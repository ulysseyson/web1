<h2>History</h2>

<p>

On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed "Somebody to Love" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band.[216] Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert[217] before the festival was cancelled.[218] Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, "It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval."[215] Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue.[219] Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012.[220][221] Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale.[222] A third London date was scheduled for 14 July.[223] On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation.[224] Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium,[225][226] and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.[227]

On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[228] The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium.[229] Following this, May performed part of the "Brighton Rock" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of "We Will Rock You".[229][230]

On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.[231] Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014[232][233] and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014.[234] In an interview with Rolling Stone, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him.[235]

In November 2014 Queen released a new album Queen Forever.[236] The album is largely a compilation of previously-released material but features three new Queen tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, "There Must Be More To Life Than This", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson.[237] Queen + Adam Lambert performed in the shadow of Big Ben in Central Hall, Westminster, central London at the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year's Eve 2014 and New Year's Day 2015.[238]

In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed "Who Wants to Live Forever" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day.[239] On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people.[240] As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017â€“2018, the band toured North America in the summer of 2017, toured Europe in late 2017, before playing dates in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018.[241] Queen + Adam Lambert will perform in North America during The Rhapsody Tour in July and August 2019.[
